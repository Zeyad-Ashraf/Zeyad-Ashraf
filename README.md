I'm a backend developer who is passionate about building robust systems and scalable APIs to power modern applications.  
Technologies I enjoy working with include **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **NestJS**, **MongoDB**, **MySQL**, and **Redis**.

ðŸš€ I have a few live projects:
- **API for Study-Stack**
- **E-commerce backend** (with JWT, payment integration)
- **Job Search App** â€“ a backend for job seekers and recruiters with advanced filtering and authentication


ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Node.js**, **NestJS**, **API Design**, and **Backend Architecture**
